# 30 Days of Streamlit

I will try to keep up with the streamlit challenges as noted in their twitter [here](https://twitter.com/streamlit/status/1509716484456558632)

I love streamlit and use it whenever I need some ad-hoc EDA so growing in familiarity sounds great!

## NOTES

* Day 4 was following along with Ken Jee - I watched the video but didn't do the app as I'm pretty familiar with plotly and build apps already with plotly figures
* Day 6 was about setting up git/GitHub which I've done from the onset
* Day 7 was on publishing to Streamlit cloud -> I don't think I'll ever do this
* Days 9-11 Are on basic streamlit components, I'm excited to see how they work together but I have built several dashboards with these comopnents already
* Day 13 is about cloud dev environment - which I have little to no use for
